# DA-1-SQL-Nashville-Housing-Data-Cleaning
Getting a file with some missing values or unwanted attributes can create hindrance in Data Analysis. Data cleaning is an essential step of Data Analysis. To practice my skills in Data cleaning, I have created this project which has cleaned the data of 'Nashville-Housing.xsl' file, taken from a Data Analyst Course from freecodecamp.org. 


# IDE
Used MicroSoft SQL Server Management Studio for running SQL queries. The excel files were imported in the SSMS through SQL DB Drive from Microsoft Server Management. The file imported were then ready to use as they were processed by SSMS.

I have learnt this from a Data Analyst Course provided by freecodecamp.org (Alex the Analyst)
